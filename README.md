# Tic-Tac-Toe


This application follows the traditional rules of the Tic-Tac-Toe game .

Logic from behind(short story):</br> </br>
There is a 3x3 matrix and a function who checks whenever the diagonals, cells, or rows are having 3 of X or 3 of O's.
If one of previous statements is not fullfiled , game ends with a draw. 

For development I used Html, Css, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and some cute gifs.
